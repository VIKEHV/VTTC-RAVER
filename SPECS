Vacuum tube: 6961A TRIODE. https://www.relltubes.com/documents/Datasheets/6961A.pdf
Transformer: 2x 5kW 120v-4200V transformers under oil in antiseries configuration to reduce dielectric stress.
Doubler: Ronken 1200V Capacitors: 4 in series, 3 in parallel with 20kV 6A diode
Primary: Tappable 40 turns of 14AWG, reinforced top two turns with PVC tubing. MICA capacitors ranging from 100pF to 2875 PF for maximum tuning range. Optional K15-Y  15KV Capacitors for dialing resonance in further to account for arc loading.
