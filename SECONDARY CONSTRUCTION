The secondary should be treated as a component that must handle 500kV at 7kW. With such a low impedance, this means that heating can become an issue. Similar to the primary construction, you should use fiberglass dowels to space it from the PVC form. 
This construction has an added bonus of keeping your dielectric losses low! 

I chose 18AWG because it will put forward a low impedance and it will handle the high pulse current from the ramp. 

Some napkin math shows how dead simple construction is.

For calculating the turns, simply multiply your wire diameter by the length in mm of your secondary.
In our case, 1mm D X 609MM H = 609 turns. 
For calculating the length of wire, measure how much length you use for one turn, then multiply by height. 

To fortify our secondary dielectric, just spray some clearcoat over the windings. If you must, add armor to minimize KV/CM.
