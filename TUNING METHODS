To find the resonant frequency of the secondary on our air-core transformer, we must perform calculations and test it with smaller, self tuning circuits such as the Slayer Exciter circuit. 

The resonant frequency calculations include all internal and external affects due to the variations in capacitance's from proximity affects of all system components. 
The resonant frequency calculations must also account for variations in inductance's and capacitance's due to the non-uniform current distribution which occurs at the resonant frequency of the resonator. 
At this frequency range, wires become inductors and capacitors, and this effect increases with frequency.

Self tuning circuits such as the slayer have a nasty habit of ringing other harmonics, such as +2 or -1. To solve this, if you suspect you are reading a sub-harmonic of +1, simply divide the frequency in half. This will give a rough estimate when you are searching for resonance.

Should you have a signal generator, wrap 3 turns around your secondary coil with spacing that mimics the coupling of your real setup. Sweep from 100kHz to 2MHz, and monitor which frequency rings the highest voltage on a nearby antenna. That will be your first harmonic.
